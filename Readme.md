R# Multivariate Linear Regression from Scratch README

This README provides an overview of the "Multivariate Linear Regression from Scratch" project, including objectives, components, usage instructions, and key considerations.

## 1. Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to implement a multivariate linear regression model from scratch. Multivariate linear regression extends simple linear regression to multiple input features and aims to predict an output variable based on a linear combination of these features. Building a multivariate linear regression model from the ground up provides an understanding of the fundamental principles behind linear regression and its mathematical underpinnings in a multi-dimensional context.

## 2. Components
To create a multivariate linear regression model from scratch, the following components need to be implemented:

### 2.1 Multivariate Linear Regression Model
- Implement the multivariate linear regression model, including parameters (weights and bias) initialization and prediction.

### 2.2 Loss Function
- Implement the loss function, typically mean squared error (MSE), to measure the model's performance.

### 2.3 Gradient Descent
- Implement the gradient descent optimization algorithm to update model parameters iteratively.

### 2.4 Data Preprocessing
- Implement data preprocessing steps, including feature scaling and bias term addition.

## 3. Usage Instructions
To use the multivariate linear regression model implemented from scratch, follow these steps:

### 3.1 Create an Instance of the Multivariate Linear Regression Model
- Instantiate the multivariate linear regression model class, initializing the model's parameters (weights and bias).

### 3.2 Prepare Data
- Prepare your dataset, including feature extraction, data cleaning, and splitting into training and testing sets.

### 3.3 Training
- Use your training data to train the multivariate linear regression model. Implement the gradient descent algorithm to update model parameters and minimize the loss function.

### 3.4 Evaluation
- Evaluate the trained model on a separate testing dataset to assess its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared).

### 3.5 Prediction
- Use the trained multivariate linear regression model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

## 4. Key Considerations
When implementing multivariate linear regression from scratch, consider the following:

- Learning Rate: Experiment with different learning rates to find an optimal value for gradient descent convergence.
- Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize input features to ensure smooth convergence during training.
- Bias Term: Add a bias term to the multivariate linear regression model to account for the intercept.
- Convergence Criteria: Implement a stopping criterion for gradient descent, such as a maximum number of iterations or a threshold for the change in the loss function.

## 5. Conclusion
Building a multivariate linear regression model from scratch is an educational project that provides insight into the core concepts of linear regression and gradient descent optimization in a multi-dimensional context. By following the usage instructions and considering key factors, you can create a functional multivariate linear regression model capable of making predictions based on multiple input features. This project is a foundational step in understanding more complex machine learning models and algorithms.
